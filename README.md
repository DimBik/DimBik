## Projects
### Identify Diseases of the GI tract
[Code](https://github.com/DimBik/DimBik/blob/main/Projects/Identify%20Diseases%20of%20the%20GI%20Tract.ipynb)

Colorectal, esophageal and stomach cancer causes 1.8 million deaths annualy, and endoscopic examination is highly important for investigation of the GI tract. Gastroscopy and Colonoscopy are real-time video examinations of the GI tract by use of digital high definition endoscopes. Accurate grading of diseases are important since it may influence decision-making on treatment and follow-up. For example, the degree of inflammation directly affects the choice of therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The goal of this project is to build a model which recognises 3 major phatological findings in a real-time video which can lead in cancer and it has been trained on dataset with the 8 following classes:

- Z-line -> The Z-line marks the transition site between the esophagus and the stomach.
- Esophagitis -> Esophagitis is an inflammation of the esophagus visible as a break in the esophageal mucosa in relation to the Z-line.
- Pylorus -> The pylorus is defined as the area around the opening from the stomach into the first part of the small bowel (duodenum).
- Polyps -> Polyps are lesions within the bowel detectable as mucosal outgrows.
- Cecum -> The cecum the most proximal part of the large bowel.
- Ulcerative Colitis -> Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the large bowel.
- Dyed and Lifted Polyps -> The light blue polyp margins are clearly visible against the darker normal mucosa.
- Dyed resection Margins -> The resection margins are important in order to evaluate whether the polyp is completely removed or not.

The models have been evaluated with 5-fold CV. Starting with a baseline model and gradually improve its performance following data augmentation techniques and improve data quality.

**_Best accuracy: 81.5%_**

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
