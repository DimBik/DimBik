## Projects
### Enhancing Real-Time GI Tract Pathology Detection
[Code](https://github.com/DimBik/DimBik/blob/main/Projects/Enhancing%20Real-Time%20GI%20Tract%20Pathology%20Detection.ipynb)

Colorectal, esophageal and stomach cancers cause 1.8 million deaths each year, making endoscopic examination crucial for examining the GI tract. Gastroscopy and Colonoscopy are real-time video examinations using high-definition degital endoscopes to inspect the GI tract. Accurate disease assessment is important as it affects treatment and follow-up decisions. For example, the level of inflammation determines the therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This project aims to create a reliable model which recognises 3 major pathological findings in real-time video. The dataset consists of the 8 following classes:

- Z-line -> Marks the transition between the esophagus and the stomach.
- Esophagitis -> Inflammation of the esophagus visible as a break in the esophageal mucosa near the Z-line.
- Pylorus -> The area around the opening from the stomach into the first part of the small bowel (duodenum).
- Polyps -> Lesions within the bowel detectable as mucosal outgrows.
- Cecum -> The most proximal part of the large bowel.
- Ulcerative Colitis -> A chronic inflammatory disease affecting the large bowel.
- Dyed and Lifted Polyps -> Light blue polyp margins are clearly visible against the darker normal mucosa.
- Dyed resection Margins -> The resection margins are important in order to evaluate whether the polyp is completely removed.

The models were evaluated with 5-fold CV. An initial baseline model with an accuracy of 72.5% was built and gradually improved to reach 81.5%. In this project, issues such as bias from the green squares and limited data were addressed.

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
